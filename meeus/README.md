A Lua implementation of (some) of the cabalistic formulas from Jan Meeus, in his [Astronomical Algorithms (Willman-Bell, 2nd edition)][1].

The code was heavily based on Bill Mc Clain astrolabe python library. Astrolabe is not available anymore. It was forked by Tim Cera, creating the [astronomia library][2] which seems to have evolved into something larger than just Meeus formulas implementation.
Another Python implementation of Meeus formulas is [pymeeus][4].

I wrote this in Lua to easily create monitors within the [Notion window manager][3]. This never really happened though (and I am now using [dwm][5]) but the exercise was fun :-)
