A Lua implementation of (some) of the cabalistic formulas from Jan Meeus, in his [Astronomical Algorithms (Willman-Bell, 2nd edition)][1].

The code was heavily based on Bill Mc Clain astrolabe python library. Astrolabe is not available anymore - or at least I could not locate it anywhere on the web last time I looked. It seems it was forked by Tim Cera, creating the [astronomia library][2].

I rewrote it in Lua mainly for easy integration of some of the calculation to create monitors within the [Notion window manager][3]. This never really happened though :-)
